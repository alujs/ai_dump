    known_issues:
      - FoW overlay previously drew unconditionally and could black out map; now gated by fogEnabled flag
      - >-
        Fixed: delete flicker by coalescing draws with rAF, skipping zero-area renders, and resizing only when bounds
        change
      - Base pre-render removed; consider tile cache for large maps (optional Phase 3)

    description: Game state becomes inconsistent or invalid
    check: Mutator sequence and state validation
    commands:
      - debug:engine
      - validate game state
    common_cause: Mutators applied in wrong order or invalid mutations
  fog_visibility_issues:
    description: Fog of War not displaying correctly for player perspective
    check: computeFogFrame player parameter and visibility calculations
    commands:
      - debug:fog
      - debug:engine
    common_cause: Player ID not passed correctly to fog computation
  queue_does_not_advance:
    description: StepEncounter produces no events
    check: Ensure commands are enqueued under correct encounterId and FIFO drain occurs on step
    commands:
      - debug:orchestrator:queue
      - debug:orchestrator:tick
    common_cause: Missing processCommand adapter or wrong encounterId
  perimeter_gaps:
    description: Perimeter appears broken or jagged when zoomed
    check: Ensure editor uses tracePerimeter over per-hex neighbor strokes; verify camera offsets and DPR scaling
    commands:
      - debug:editor
      - debug:render
    common_cause: Old neighbor-based outline path still called or camera scroll not applied to edge endpoints
